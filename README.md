## This repository (documentation)

* Intro slides - not much here yet
    * [Notes on the slide](slides.md), including to-do
    * [Slides so far](slides/) - not so much

* [Cookbook](cookbook.md) - practical how-tos for various use-cases. Not
  everything described here is implemented, but if it's on this page it
  is imminent.

* [Implementation](implementation.md) - detailed technical notes.

* [To do]() - these are smallish, short-term, miscellaneous items

* [Roadmap](roadmap.md) - high-level direction I'm going; something like
  broad, long-term to-do items.

* [Future](future.md) - more hypothetical, wacky ideas.

* [More notes](more-notes.md) - grab-bag for notes that need to be organized
